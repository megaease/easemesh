## EaseMesh ShadowService Controller

EaseMesh manages all the services deployed based on Kubernetes. So, we can use the Kubernetes to replicate all the services instances to another copy.
We call this the "Shadow Service". After that, we can schedule the test traffic to the "shadow service" for the test.
